<h1>Magic-Tomorrow X Together</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 125%; background-color: white; text-align: center;"> <br>Remember how I used to be so</br>
        <br> Stuck in one place, so cold?</br>
        <br>Feeling like my heart just froze</br>
        <br>Nowhere to go with no one, nobody</br>
        <br>Suddenly, you came through</br>
        <br>Making me make a move</br>
        <br>Nobody got it like you</br>
        <br>I can't look away, I can't</br>
        <br>'Cause baby, you're a real one, real one</br>
        <br>Teaching me to feel something so strong (strong)</br>
        <br>We could reach out and grab it</br>
        <br>Oh, it's just like magic</br>
        <br>Feeling your touch, oh, it's a rush</br>
        <br>No one else has it</br>
        <br>It's just like magic (just like magic)</br>
        <br>Oh, it's just like magic</br>
        <br>Holding me tight, giving me life</br>
        <br>Oh-oh, it's magic (magic)</br>
        <br>Oh-oh, it's magic (oh, it's just like magic)</br>
        <br>Oh-oh, it's magic, oh-oh, it's magic</br>
        <br>(Just like magic) Oh-oh, it's magic</br>
        <br>Magic</br>
        <br>Used to be so afraid</br>
        <br>Afraid of all the games we played</br>
        <br>Waited around all day</br>
        <br>Nowhere to go with no one, nobody</br>
        <br>Hoping someone would save me</br>
        <br>'Til you called out my name</br>
        <br>Something in me just changed</br>
        <br>Got me awake, got me</br>
        <br>Baby, you're a real one, real one</br>
        <br>Teaching me to feel something so strong (strong)</br>
        <br>We could reach out and grab it</br>
        <br>Oh, it's just like magic</br>
        <br>Feeling your touch, oh, it's a rush</br>
        <br>No one else has it</br>
        <br>It's just like magic (just like magic)</br>
        <br>Oh, it's just like magic</br>
        <br>Holding me tight, giving me life</br>
        <br>Oh-oh, it's magic (magic)</br>
        <br>Oh-oh, it's magic (oh, it's just like magic)</br>
        <br>Everybody, clap your hands (no, no, no)</br>
        <br>If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance (oh, oh, no, no, no)</br>
        <br>I say everybody, clap your hands</br>
        <br>If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance (magic, magic)</br>
        <br>Everybody, clap your hands</br>
        <br>If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance (chance)</br>
        <br>I say everybody, clap your hands</br>
        <br>If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance (ooh)</br>
        <br>I say everybody, clap your hands</br>
        <br>If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance (chance)</br>
        <br>I say everybody, clap your hands</br>
        <br>If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance, say</br>
        <br>Oh, it's just like magic (just like magic, yeah, eh)</br>
        <br>Feeling your touch, oh, it's a rush</br>
        <br>No one else has it</br>
        <br>It's just like magic (just like magic)</br>
        <br>Oh, it's just like magic (just like magic)</br>
